    You focused on <strong><em>sine</em></strong>, written $ \sin $, to begin. Given the length of the long side, $ r $, this ratio stated that $ \sin{\theta} = \frac{y}{r} $. Equations such as these showed up when you sent stars flying in a straight line. Letâ€™s revisit that simpler case for a moment.

    An equation is a statement of equality. It claims that whatever expression is on the left produces the same value as the expression on the right. For example,
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 $
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    No surprises here. Now, you could rearrange this equation such that there is only one term on the left. You could undo, or <strong><em>invert</em></strong>, the multiplication by applying division. Since the sides are equal, what you do to one side, you must do to the other.

<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ \frac{2 \cdot 3}{3} = \frac{6}{3} $
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ 2 = \frac{6}{3} $
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ 2 = 2 $
