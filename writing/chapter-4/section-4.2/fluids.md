    The wave had revealed its true form and it was beautiful. You quickly thought of a million and one things that might rise and fall according to such a steady rhythm. The first thought that came to mind was stardust – big bundles of it you would call a <strong><em>fluid</em></strong>.
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
You imagined waves propagating through such fluids and realized you had a problem: you needed to draw all of the points on the wave <em>at the same time</em>. This meant drawing lots of points.
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    The <code>draw()</code> function executed all of its code in an endless loop. You used it along with the <code>frameCount</code> variable to update your computations and draw additional points.
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    “Why limit myself to this built-in loop?” you wondered.
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    “I don’t know. And who are you talking to?” you replied.
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    So you set out to construct your first loop. They worked like this:
</p>
<pre><code data-trim class="language-javascript">
for (start; stop; step) {
  // commands to repeat
}
</code></pre>
