    You originally named the variable <code>r</code> to represent the radius of a circle, but there was no circle to be found in this sketch. After mulling it over, you gave this variable a new name, <code>amp</code>, for <strong><em>amplitude</em></strong>. You saw a couple of other unlabeled numbers, or <strong><em>magic numbers</em></strong>, so you gave them names as well.
