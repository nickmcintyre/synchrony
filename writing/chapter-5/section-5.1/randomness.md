    It was alive! But the bug ran off almost as soon as it appeared. You thought about the problem for a moment and decided to ditch the straight and narrow path once again.

    No, predictable lines and orbits simply wouldnâ€™t do. Your new friend would be unpredictable.

<p class="main-text small-text">
    Instead of moving steadily to the left or right, the bug might jump either left or right, depending on how it felt during that frame. The same would go for its vertical movement. You controlled unpredictability, or <strong><em>randomness</em></strong>, with the <code>random()</code> function.
</p>
<pre><code data-trim class="language-javascript">
random(high)      // -> 0 to high
random(low, high) // -> low to high
</code></pre>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    The <code>random()</code> function returns numbers between a low and high value with no particular pattern or preference. Calling <code>random(2, 5)</code> returns some number between $ 2 $ and $ 5 $ such as $ 2.71828 $ or $ 3.14159 $.
