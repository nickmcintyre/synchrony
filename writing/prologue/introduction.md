    Here's the plan: I will help you to remember how you modeled the universe using one formal language (math notation) and
    created it using another formal language (computer code). My hope for you is that you walk away from each exercise
    a little more confident that you can understand anything you see and construct anything you can imagine.

    Many years ago, a person named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert" target="_blank">Seymour Papert</a> imagined teaching children to
    "talk mathematics" to a computer. He wrote a book, too, and he called it <em><a href="https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Mindstorms</a></em>.
    Here is what he said:

<blockquote class="main-text small-text">
    The idea of “talking mathematics” to a computer can be generalized to a view of learning mathematics in “Mathland”; that is to say, in a context
    which is to learning mathematics what living in France is to learning French.

    Welcome back to Mathland.
