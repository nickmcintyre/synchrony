    You spent quite some time staring off into space before you asked yourself, “Where, exactly, am I in this universe of mine?” It was a big question. Stars moved from one position to another, but what was your position?

    Then it hit you: you could make something to sit on!
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    You made this thing out of stardust and called it a “planet”. Now the ideas really started coming. You put planets around lots of stars. Then you put smaller planets around bigger planets and called the smaller planets “moons”.
</p>

    The cosmos was finally taking form, so you inspected your handiwork from the surface of a planet. Moons were much closer to planets than stars and appeared much larger, so you decided to draw them with round things called <strong><em>circles</em></strong>.
