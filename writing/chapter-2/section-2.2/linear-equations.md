    This pattern of changing an object’s $ y $-coordinate with respect to its $ x $-coordinate based on multiplication and addition seemed useful. The star always moved in a straight line, so you called this relationship a <strong><em>linear equation</em></strong> and wrote it like so:
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ y = mx + b $
</p>
<p class="main-text small-text">
    $ m  $, called the <strong><em>slope</em></strong>, determined the slant of the star’s path. $ b $, called the <strong><em>$ y $-intercept</em></strong>, determined where the star began its journey.
