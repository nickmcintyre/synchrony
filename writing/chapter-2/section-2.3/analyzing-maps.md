    You figured that you could multiply any number by $ 0.5 $ and then add $ 50 $ to that value. And there was nothing special about those numbers; you could multiply any number by another number $ m $ and then add another number $ b $ to that value. $ x $ could be anything!

    Then, you followed a star along its path forever as its $ y $-coordinate grew without bound. You even imagined reversing time and following the star back to when its $ y $-coordinate was negative. The idea of moving backward in time seemed familiar, and you knew intuitively that this was OK.

    So, there it was: a linear function $ f $ would accept any number $ x $ as an input and could produce any number $ f(x) $ as an output. The domain and range of $ f $ both included all possible numbers. You called "the set of all possible numbers" the <strong><em>real numbers</em></strong>, or $ \R $ for short.
