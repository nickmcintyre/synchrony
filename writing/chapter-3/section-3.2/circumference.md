    You measured length in pixels and time in frames, and you needed some way to measure the amount of rotation. Since you planned to rotate around a circle, you based your new unit on circles. You called the length from the center of a circle to its edge its <strong><em>radius</em></strong>, $ r $, and you called the distance around the edge of the circle its <strong><em>circumference</em></strong>, $ c $.
