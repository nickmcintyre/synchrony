    That new number $ \pi $, called “pi”, would show up everywhere and contain everything – don’t worry about how just yet. You drew another picture based on this equation and decided that you could describe rotations in terms of $ r $. You called these angles <strong><em>radians</em></strong> and there were $ 2 \pi $ of them in a full rotation.
